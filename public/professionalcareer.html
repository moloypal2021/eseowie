                practice in Governance especially in emerging economies, Dr Owie served between 2011 and 2016, as
                Executive Director & Chief Responsibility Officer of the Centre for International Trade & Policy
                (CITaP), Geneva, Switzerland. CiTAP, is a Think Tank and Research Centre that provides cutting-edge,
                actionable advice to Governments, Non-State Actors and Civil Society Organizations on, amongst other
                things, the mainstreaming of Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) considerations in Trade Policy
                Formulation and Sequencing, Sustainability and Developmental Strategy.</p>
            <p class="sm:text-base text-sm text-paragraph mb-12">In the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, Dr
                Owie
                co-founded Climate Change Africa (CCA), a Third Sector Policy Action and Research Centre that is
                committed to taking urgent action to cut greenhouse gas emissions, speed the global shift to renewables
                and a sustainable green economy. CCA has, over the years, demonstrated commitment to building a more
                just and equitable world, one where all voices, especially those of the Global South, are heard and
                respected in the global climate change debate. CCA recognizes that a diverse and inclusive movement is
                critical to solving the climate crisis, and that to build this coalition, Nations must ensure that those
                directly impacted – particularly those who have been excluded in the past – are at the center of the
                movement for change., CCA is thus at the forefront of raising awareness that indigenous peoples,
                low-income families and other historically marginalized groups in Africa represent frontline communities
                who experience harmful climate impacts first and are worse hit. The international community must
                consequently commit to understanding and undoing the historic injustices which contribute to this
                reality and, in proffering solutions, address systemic inequities.</p>
